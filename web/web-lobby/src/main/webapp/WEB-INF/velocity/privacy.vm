    <div id="terms-service">
 <p>Yazino has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm belief and commitment to privacy.</p>
	<p>The following statement details what information we obtain from you, how we use it and how we fulfill our obligations to protect your privacy. Please read it carefully. By using the Yazino site and its services, you will be agreeing that you are happy for Yazino to gather and use your information in the ways stated in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Browsing the Sites</h4>
    <p>At Yazino we like to ensure that we will continue to meet the demands of our customers. To help us to understand your needs and improve the relevance of the services we offer you as an individual, we may collect anonymous information on your browsing activity while using Yazino's Services, such as IP address, browser type or referring URL.</p>
    <p>You cannot be identified personally as a result of the information we collect while you use our Services and we mainly examine browsing activity to monitor aggregated site traffic and analyse it.</p>
    <p>We may also provide anonymous statistics about user's activity to reputable third party vendors, but these will not include details that would allow the recipient to identify you.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Cookies</h4>
    <p>Internet cookies are common and do not harm your system - they just store or gather site information. They help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don't have to re-enter them when revisiting a site. We use cookies to recognise returning visitors and to deliver content specific to your interests. We don't use cookies to track people's Internet usage after leaving our Sites and we don't store personal information in them that others could read and understand. We will not sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.</p>
    <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many sites, including this one.</p>
